Market regime classification for swing_trading

This is my capstone project in partial fulfillment for the award of MSc Financial Engineering from World Quant University. 
The project understudied the use of Hidden Markov model to classify the regime states of several assets. 
With the regime states information ascertained beforehand, selected trading strategies were backtested with the selected assets to obtain 
which of the assets performed well with any of the moving average and crossover strategies in terms of annual and cumulative returns 
and riskadjusted return performance. The algorithm used for market regime classification and backtesting of the strategies were developed in python programming language
